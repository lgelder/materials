#Scrumptious non-functional requirements:

Usability – come up with a consistent UI, test it with users to make sure they like it and can navigate it.  Document well. Put user in control.
Reliability – Make sure it doesn’t crash or get errors
Performance – Research ways to maintain speed and efficiency of app.
Supportability – Make it easy to maintain and repair, partially through modularity.
